# Ground control
This is a collection of all my scripts that I use to debug Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF), blind XSS, and insecure XXE processing vulnerabilities. This is still a work in progress, as I'm still collecting all the scripts that I have lingering around.

## Requirements
Running this script requires PHP 5.6, a valid SSL certificate for a domain you own, and a web server that allows to open port `80`, `443`, `8080`, and `8443`. The use of each port will be explained in this document.
